# Biological - Variable Topology Neural Network Simulator (VTNNS).
Code archive of Variable Topology Neural Network Simulator (VTNNS) based on LIF model.  Original creation date Aug-2015.

------------------
- Code repository for intership conducted under National Network for Mathematical and Computational Biology (NNMCB), during the summer of 2015.
- This work was conducted with collaboration with Dr.Deepak Mishra, Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology.
- All packages are written in Fortran for faster computations. Please do individual version check (F90 or F95).
- All the packages used are written by the author, except gnuplot used for visualizaiton. 
- For context of the simulations, please refer to `/.report.pdf` or `./presentation.pdf`.
