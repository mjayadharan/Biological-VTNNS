Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure may not
 be suitable.
 Here are some rules that apply for this solution: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At *most* three subsections per section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Talk about 30s to 2min per frame.
 So there should be between about 15 and 30 frames, all told.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you are going
 to talk about.
 So *simplify*! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard enough.
 Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than you think necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation, just say
 so once.
 Everybody will be happy with that.

What is neural Signal Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Frame

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Neurons can be can be considered as the most fundamental and core unit of
 the nervous system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
They are electrically excitable cells which helps in the propogation of
 information through electrical and chemical interactions within an organism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Neurons can be sensory, motor or interconnecting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Neurons interconnect to form neural network
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sole purpose of neural signal processing is to understand how information
 is represented, transmitted and stored in the nervous system and develop
 the mechanism to record and interpret these signals

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Neurons usually maintain a difference in electric potential across its cell
 membrane
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unequal distribution of charged ions(Na+,K+,Ca2+, cl- etc) accounts for
 this membrane potential difference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cell membrane has selectively permeable ion channels which facilitates the
 movement of corrensponding ions

\begin_layout Itemize
signals are processed across an excitable neuron in the form of propogating
 spikes or action potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A slight decrease in membrane potential makes membrane more permeable to
 Na+ than K+, and a positive feedback loop facilitates further depolarization
 to form a sharp peak in the voltage across the membrane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Action potential is an all or nothing event.
